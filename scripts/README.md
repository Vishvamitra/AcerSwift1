# Explanation
Here you can find some scripts which I use on my system.

- `cutefetch`

A very simple script that prints some informations about the system you're running in the terminal emulatir: Kernel version, OS, uptime, CPU model and the count of installed packages (this one only works for Debian and, possibly, for Debian-based distributions).


- `screenshot`

A simple script for taking screenshots using `scrot`, moving them to a specific folder and naming them with a specific pattern.
